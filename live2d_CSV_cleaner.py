# CONSTRAINTS
# ID can't be longer than 64 characters, currently just catches and prompts user to shorten Name
# FIXME: Might be able to handle this with shortening ID, but everyone wants different things with that
# ALL IDs need to be unique, import failures will happen if any IDs conflict, the problem is sneaky
# because if you export ArtMesh data only, when you import, a Part (folder) could share the same ID

# If multiple layers or folders share the same NAME before exporting to CSV
# they will automatically be renamed to NAME, NAME2, NAME{n} ...
# But there are cases where we have duplicate malformed names that get their ID's set to ArtMesh{n}
# So when we clean the NAMEs to be compliant, we need to check if we have a duplicate of that name
# We have already updated the ID to be the new name,
# and if we do we need to adjust the ID to be {CLEANED_NAME + occurrence_count}
# Two parts named Left Eyelash would become -> Left_Eyelash & Left_Eyelash2
# The handleDuplicates() function will take the n-th occurrence of a cleaned NAME and fix its id
# it needs the NAME string, the row that it is from, and the occurrence number

# Parameters:
# DataFrame : dataframe row, we can edit inplace.
# Index : location of row to modify in place

    # DEPRECATED: Don't edit an ID of a file if its valid, could conflict with Part names
